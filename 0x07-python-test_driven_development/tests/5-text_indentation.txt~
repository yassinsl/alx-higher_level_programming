 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``my_function()``.

Numbers
=======

``my_function()`` returns the product of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``*`` operator.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

Errors
======
