# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This repository contains several tasks related to JavaScript objects, scopes and closures.

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. Objects, scopes, and closures are key concepts of JavaScript programming that allow developers to write more efficient and flexible code.

## Tasks Overview
This repository contains the following tasks:

### [0. Rectangle #0](./0-rectangle.js)

Defines an empty `Rectangle` class.

### [1. Rectangle #1](./1-rectangle.js)

Adds a constructor to the `Rectangle` class that takes two arguments (`width` and `height`) and initializes them.

### [2. Rectangle #2](./2-rectangle.js)

Adds conditional validation to the constructor of `Rectangle` to ensure that `width` and `height` are greater than 0.

### [3. Rectangle #3](./3-rectangle.js)

Adds an instance method `print()` to the `Rectangle` class that prints out the rectangle using the character `X`.

### [4. Rectangle #4](./4-rectangle.js)

Adds two instance methods to the `Rectangle` class:

- `rotate()`: swaps the `width` and `height` values of the rectangle.
- `double()`: multiplies both the `width` and `height` values of the rectangle by 2.

### [5. Square #0](./5-square.js)

Defines a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class.

### [6. Square #1](./6-square.js)

Adds a constructor to the `Square` class that takes one argument (`size`) and initializes it.

### [7. Occurrences](./7-occurrences.js)

Defines a function `occurrences()` that returns the number of occurrences of a element in an array.

### [8. Esrever](./8-esrever.js)

Defines a function `esrever()` that returns the reversed version of a list (`Array`).

### [9. Log me](./9-logme.js)

Defines a function `logMe()` that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### [10. Number conversion](./10-converter.js)

Defines a function `convertNumber()` that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as argument.

### [11. Factor index](./100-map.js)

Uses the `map` function to returns a list with each value equal to the value of the initial list at the same position, multipled by the index of the position plus one.

### [12. Sorted occurences](./101-sorted.js)

Imports an array of occurrences from `100-map.js` and returns a new sorted array of the occurrences.

### [13. Concat files](./102-concat.js)

Concatenates 2 files and saves the result to a new file. The file names are passed as arguments to the script.

## Conclusion

The JavaScript concepts of objects, scopes and closures are fundamental to writing efficient and flexible code. By completing these tasks, you should have a better understanding of how to use these concepts in your own code.
